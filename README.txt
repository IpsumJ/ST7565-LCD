This is library is based on the Adafruit ST7565 lib with changes to work with
the GWMS5509 LCD module.

---

There are two 'versions' of the LCD library - one is straightup avr-gcc and the other is an Arduino Library. They're essentially the same.

You can create new icons for bitmapdisplaying using bmp2glcd
